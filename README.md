## Non Communicable Disease Across Various Countries
### Description
This repository showcases the findings from an analysis exploring the correlation between Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and various socioeconomic factors across different countries. The analysis was conducted using Tableau, leveraging a pre-cleaned dataset containing information on Body Mass Index (BMI), raised blood pressure (RBP), diabetes prevalence, and income levels of different countries.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following variables:

Country: Name of the country
- BMI: Body Mass Index of the population
- Raised Blood Pressure (RBP): Prevalence of raised blood pressure
- Diabetes Prevalence: Percentage of population with diabetes

### Key Findings
- Income and Raised Blood Pressure: Through visual analysis, it was observed that there is a notable relationship between the income of a country and the prevalence of raised blood pressure. Specifically, countries in Africa, characterized by lower income levels, tend to exhibit higher rates of raised blood pressure. Furthermore, deeper exploration revealed that this trend is particularly pronounced among men in these regions.

- Correlation between BMI and Diabetes: The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and diabetes prevalence across the dataset. However, there was a weak to no correlation observed between raised blood pressure and the other two variables.

### Detailed Insights
In addition to these overarching findings, the analysis delved into specific countries contributing to the observed trends. Through interactive visualizations and exploratory analysis, regional variations were identified, and outliers were highlighted, providing nuanced insights into the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and NCD prevalence.
